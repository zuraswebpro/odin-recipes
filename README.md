# odin-recipes

This is an HTML project for building a website for Recipes from the Odin Project.
This is the first project in HTML Foundations.

By the end I will have a fully functioning HTML webpage complete with links and images.

I started this project on Monday 12/25/2023

This was a fun little HTML project. Nothing gave me any trouble except I missed
one step which was adding the Description h2 to the recipes, but I caught it at the end and added it in.
